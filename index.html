                <h3 class="mb-3">trevorsuarez.me Design Rationale</h3>
                <p>This design needed to be simple, as there is not lots of content to be displayed. Starting with that mission, I built the site, so it was easy to navigate (single page) and added the color Mango to reflect my characteristics in color theory.
                    People who know me describe me as a cheerful, outgoing, and confident person. By choosing mango as my site’s main color, I want visitors to get a feel for my energy as if they were meeting me in person. On the main screen, I chose
                    to make my name larger to help draw the visitor in to read the small bio about me. I also made sure to include social media links because this is a professional portfolio, which means they are looking at my work. I knew if I would
                    add a giant picture or video, the attention would be on the picture/video and not on my info and experiences. I chose the one-page layout as I believe it simplifies the interaction without any extra complexities. The one-page layout
                    removes the need for back and forward buttons because the navbar is always present and the user can scroll at their own pace. I chose to put the navigation bar on the left side because vertical space is always limited, but many screens
                    have horizontal space. That way, I can maximize the vertical space on each page. Most visitors of the site are interested in learning about me and my experiences/skills. Therefore, I highlight each internship/job I currently have or
                    had in the past using dedicated paragraphs with individual top headers. Having skills/tools as another highlight with logos helps people get a quick overview without having to read, thus saving time while getting the message at the
                    same time. Overall, I hope the simple design attracts professionals and helps edge myself out amongst the competition. Without a doubt, the motivation March discusses that my design relates to most is status. As a Software Engineering
                    student, I need to create examples of my work for potential employers can view as well as to provide me with a project to talk about in interviews. These reasons are why I wanted to create a project that I can call mine. With my software
                    engineering a user experience knowledge, I believe this is a great representation of two of my interests combined. For the visitors of this site, I want them to see it and take away a little small piece of me when they navigate to
                    another site. I’m not trying to be popular by having a site, I simply want to have a bold presence for those who do make a visit.</p>
                <h3 class="mb-3">UX 1400 Reflection</h3>
                <p>I learned that UX is more than just making things pretty and easy to read on a screen, it is way more than that. Let me explain. On the first day of class, we had to all answer “What is UX?” This perplexed me, because this question challenged
                    my knowledge of UX. The motivation in myself that I discovered on the first day of class propelled me to learning a wide range of topics including design tactics and motivations. I assumed that there were always standards that should
                    be met, and that’s it. Reading from Marsh’s book and hearing from a few UX professionals, I quickly realized that everyone has their own style, but a style that still mimics UX to the core. I am also grateful for the opportunity to
                    integrate my iterative design thinking into the class curriculum. This was another way I could get used to working with others and opening my perspective to others who aren’t familiar to iterative design thinking. This course is related
                    to my career aspirations in big way. Lately, I have found myself at a crossroad because I don’t want to be a 24/7 developer, but I am not sure what alternate paths there are that leverage my SE and UX skills. This is my last class
                    in the UX minor path and without this class, I wouldn’t be currently considering UX as a possible path of mine. The more I use my skills in my SE work such as designing UIs or creating brands, the more I realize that UX could be my
                    path. As a result, this class has changed me, but it will take time to see how great of an influence it had on my path.</p>

                <h3 class="mb-3">Discovery World</h3>
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>
                    When the Discovery World project was first introduced, my initial thought was “they want me to go discover what other people are discovering at Discovery World.” I was astonished as I have never had worked on an external UX project, but in the end, I
                    did learn a thing or two about myself and how I analyze environments. To provide a little background, Discovery World is a museum/hands-on interactive learning environment located on the shoreline of Lake Michigan downtown Milwaukee,
                    Wisconsin. My group chose to take a deeper look into Automation Everywhere by Rockwell Automation. The exhibit explores how industrial robots don’t necessarily have to be used for factory floors, but instead playing games showing off
                    their smarts and technology. I was tasked with being a field researcher which included visiting discovery world, analyzing the exhibit, and coming up with ratings for the robots. I also played parts in digital researching, interviewing
                    exhibit visitors, and helping create the final deliverable. The final deliverable was an analysis of the current exhibit and improvements. Some of the improvements that we suggested were repositioning some of the screens visitors used
                    and creating clearer instructions in eye’s sight and arm’s reach of where the user was standing. The project lasted a total of three weeks, one week for initial research, the next for visiting discovery works, and then the remaining
                    week for completing the report.</p>
                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <p class="mb-5">
                    Not only did the team learned that there are some rough user experiences in the exhibit, we learned the characteristics and gained the skills necessary to identify poor user experiences. We did a great job identifying the brand strength and defining some
                    improvements for the exhibit. I gained hands on, real world experience, something that I didn’t receive when working on my own projects. It was surreal asking museum goers what they thought of the exhibit and watching them figure out
                    the learning curve for some of the robots in Automation Everywhere. This user feedback is something I wish I could get for some of my own projects! For the next UX 1400 project, I decided I wanted to focus on spending more time as
                    a team coming to consensus, as I feel everyone was on slightly different pages. I really took this to heart, especially when Dr. Beck involved me in the planning of the next project, Tricklebee Café.</p>

                <h3 class="mb-3 ">Tricklebee Cafe</h3>
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>
                    I was involved in two major components of the Tricklebee Café project. Before the project kickoff, Dr. Beck gave me the opportunity to help him with the planning of the project. I was able to integrate my experience with iterative design thinking and
                    creative problem solving to help him decide the daily missions for the class. The problem Dr. Beck and I decided on a vague problem statement to allow flexibly with each group. “How might we create awareness for Tricklebee Café.” Once
                    the project kicked off, the class was assigned different teams than the Discovery World project. My Tricklebee Café team had one week to complete this project. We needed to come up with a target audience, brainstorm ideas, and create
                    the pitch. The team decided to target our minimum viable product (MVP) towards farmers in southeastern Wisconsin. I was personally tasked with organizing the group and build out the pitch format. I also helped conduct the brainstorming
                    sessions as I have experience iterating through creative problems such as this one. Although the problem seemed simple to solve, it was very complex and required lots of attention to the details. We quickly learned creating awareness
                    can come in many shapes and forms. The details were in the story of our persona and how other personas (farmers) would me interacting with the MVP.</p>
                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <p class="mb-5">
                    The team decided to target farmers because they are the source of the food. The farmers bring the food to many places such as grocery stores and farmer’s markets. This means that they have food in bulk and possibly other food that they cannot sell. This
                    is where the project’s MVP begins. For the pitch, the team told the story of Greg, who is a farmer in Southeastern Wisconsin. He is a community man, who appreciates giving back. He first saw an ad for Trickebee Cafe, then got talking
                    to the owner, then decided to contribute. It was the relationship that he built with the owner that drone his motivation. There are more farmers like Greg, who step to the plate when a meaningful connection is made. This project helped
                    me learn that people relate to stories, so when they have something to grasp, it can be a truly magical result. This project wasn’t all smooth sailing. Working with this team challenged by brain, especially because they couldn’t get
                    past the brainstorming activities and what the problem statement looked like. It was my challenge to translate my knowledge of design thinking to a format they could understand. I was able reuse skills that I am currently learning
                    at The Commons and shared those skills with my group.</p>
