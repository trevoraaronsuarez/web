                <h3 class="mb-3">trevorsuarez.me Design Rationale</h3>
                <p>This design needed to be simple, as there is not lots of content to be displayed. Starting with that
                    mission, I built the site, so it was easy to navigate (single page) and added a bright orange to
                    reflect my characteristics in the color theory. I mostly corelate with friendly, cheerful,
                    confidence. The orange/mango color happens to be the same color that I wanted my HydroFlask to be.
                    On the main screen, I chose to make my name larger to help draw the visitor in to read the small bio
                    about me. I also made sure to include social media links because this is a professional portfolio,
                    which means they are looking at my work. I knew if I would add a giant picture or video, the
                    attention would be on the picture/video and thus not on my info and experiences. In terms of the one
                    page, I believe staying on one page is necessary to simplify how a user interacts. No need for back
                    and forward buttons because the navbar is always present and scrolling works too. I chose to put the
                    navigation bar on the left side because vertical space is always limited, but many screens have
                    horizontal space. That way, I can maximize the vertical space on each page. Visitors of the site are
                    interested in learning about me and my experiences/skills. Therefore, I highlight each
                    internship/job I have had in their own dedicated paragraph with individual top headers. Having
                    skills/tools as another highlight with logos helps people get a quick overview without having to
                    read, thus saving time while getting the message at the same time. Overall, I hope the simple design
                    attracts professionals and helps edge myself out amongst the competition. Without a doubt, the
                    motivation March discuss that I designed for is status, as discussed in Marsh. As a SE background, I
                    cannot have websites that are created using a drag and drop builder. It’s a disgrace to the software
                    engineering community. With that being said, I wanted to create a project that I can call mine as an
                    example of my skills all wrapped into one. With my software engineering a user experience knowledge,
                    I believe this is a great representation of two of my interests combined. For the visitors of this
                    site, I want them to see it and take away a little small piece of me when they navigate to another
                    site. I’m not trying to be popular by having a site, I simply want to have a bold presence for those
                    who do make a visit. By choosing mango as the main color, I wanted to communicate my energy and
                    warmth as if the person was meeting me. </p>
                <h3 class="mb-3">UX 1400 Reflection</h3>
                <p>I learned that UX is more than just making things pretty and easy to read on a screen, it is way more
                    than that. Let me explain. On the first day of class, we had to all answer “What is UX?” This
                    perplexed me, because this question challenged my knowledge of UX. The motivation in myself that I
                    discovered on the first day of class propelled me to learning a wide range of topics including
                    design tactics and motivations. My biggest takeaway was that UX concepts can be used in more than
                    one way depending on the scenario at hand. I assumed that there were always standards that should be
                    met, and that’s it. Reading from Marsh’s book and hearing from UX professionals, I have realized
                    that everyone has their own style, but in a way that still mimics UX to the core. I am also grateful
                    for the opportunity to integrate my iterative design thinking into the class curriculum. This was
                    another way I could get used to working with others and opening my perspective to others who aren’t
                    familiar to iterative design thinking. This course related to my career aspirations because I am at
                    a crossroad in my SE path. I don’t want to be a 24/7 developer, but I am not sure what I do want to
                    be. This is my last class in the UX minor path and without this class, I wouldn’t be currently
                    considering UX as a possible path of mine. The more I use my skills in my SE work such as designing
                    UIs or creating brands, the more I realize that UX could be my path. As a result, this class has
                    changed me, but it will take time to see how great of an influence it had on my path.</p>

                <h3 class="mb-3">Discovery World</h3>
                <p>When the Discovery World project was first introduced, my initial thought was “they want me to go
                    discover what other people are discovering at Discovery World.” I was astonished, but in the end, I
                    did learn a thing or two about myself and how I analyze environments. To provide a little
                    background, Discovery World is a museum/hands-on interactive learning environment located on the
                    shoreline of Lake Michigan downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. My group chose to take a deeper look into
                    Automation Everywhere by Rockwell Automation. The exhibit explores how industrial robots don’t
                    necessarily have to be used for factory floors, but instead playing games showing off their smarts
                    and technology. I was tasked with being a researcher which included visiting discovery world,
                    analyzing the exhibit, and coming up with ratings for the robots. The final deliverable was an
                    analysis of the current exhibit and improvements that we believe could be made to the interactions
                    between the robots and exhibit visitors. We had roughly three weeks to complete the project.</p>
                <h4 class="mb-3">Reflection</h4>
                <p class="mb-5">The team learned that there are some rough user experiences in the exhibit. We did a
                    great job identifying the brand strength and did a great job with the descriptions of how things can
                    improve. I gained hands on, real world experience, something that I didn’t receive when working on
                    my own projects. For the next project, I would focus on spending more time as a team coming to
                    consensus, as I feel everyone was on slightly different pages. This was something that I worked on
                    for the next project, Tricklebee Café. </p>

                <h3 class="mb-3">Tricklebee Cafe</h3>
                <p>For the Tricklebee Café project, I was given the opportunity to help build the curriculum for the
                    project. I was able to bring to the table my experiences with iterative design thinking and creative
                    problem solving to help build the daily missions for the class. For the project, my team decided to
                    target our pitch towards farmers in southeastern Wisconsin. The project only lasted one week. I was
                    personally tasked with organizing the group and build out the pitch format. I also helped conduct
                    the brainstorming sessions as I have experience iterating through creative problems such as this
                    one. As a group, we were constrained to creating awareness for Tricklebee Cafe. Although that might
                    seem simple, it was very complex and required lots of attention to the details. Creating awareness
                    can come in many shapes and forms. The details lied in the story of our persona and how other
                    personas (farmers) would me interacting with the minimum viable product (MVP). </p>
                <h4 class="mb-3">Reflection</h4>
                <p class="mb-5">The team decided to target farmers because they are the source of the food. The farmers
                    bring the food to many places such as grocery stores and farmer’s markets. This means that they have
                    food in bulk and possibly other food that they cannot sell. This is where the project’s MVP begins.
                    For the pitch, the team told the story of Greg, who is a farmer in Southeastern Wisconsin. He is a
                    community man, who appreciates giving back. He first saw an ad for Trickebee Cafe, then got talking
                    to the owner, then decided to contribute. It was the relationship that he built with the owner that
                    drone his motivation. There are more farmers like Greg, who step to the plate when a meaningful
                    connection is made. This project helped me learn that people relate to stories, so when they have
                    something to grasp, it can be a truly magical result. This project wasn’t all smooth sailing.
                    Working with this team challenged by brain, especially because they couldn’t get past the
                    brainstorming activities and what the problem statement looked like. It was my challenge to
                    translate the design thinking to a meaning they could understand. I revisited skills that I am
                    currently learning at The Commons and shared those skills with my group. </p>
